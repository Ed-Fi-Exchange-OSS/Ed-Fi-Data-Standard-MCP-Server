# Ideas for further improvement

## Packaging and Distribution

Package this tool for download and install, without having to run `npm` commands.

## Endpoint Testing Tool

Add a tool that lets users send test requests to endpoints (with sample payloads) and view responses, using the loaded OpenAPI spec for validation.

## Schema Visualization

Visualize relationships between entities (students, assessments, schools, etc.) using diagrams (e.g., Mermaid, PlantUML, or Graphviz) generated from the OpenAPI spec.

## Change Log/Version Diff Tool

Add a tool to compare two Ed-Fi Data Standard versions and summarize differences in endpoints and schemas.

## Authentication Guidance

Provide step-by-step guides and code samples for authenticating against Ed-Fi APIs (OAuth2, API keys, etc.).

## Enhanced Search

Support fuzzy search and filtering by tags, methods, or resource types for endpoints and schemas.

## Export Documentation

Allow exporting endpoint or schema details as Markdown or HTML for use in external documentation.

## Interactive CLI

Provide an interactive CLI mode for local exploration and testing, in addition to MCP protocol support.

## Usage Analytics (Opt-in)

Collect anonymized usage data to help improve the server and understand which features are most valuable.

## Integration Recipes

Include ready-to-use code snippets for common Ed-Fi API tasks (student enrollment, assessment submission, etc.) in multiple languages.

## MCP Protocol Extensions

Add custom MCP tools for Ed-Fi-specific tasks, such as validating data against Ed-Fi rules or simulating API calls.

## Data Mapping Assistant

Help users map their local data structures to Ed-Fi schemas, with suggestions and validation.

## Sample Payload Generator

Automatically generate sample JSON payloads for any endpoint, based on the schema, to help with integration and testing.

## Help Command

Provide a Help command that displays basic usage information.
